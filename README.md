<h3>How I became a developer</h5>
I was always interested in technology and had an interest in computers, smartphones and everything with buttons and or screens from a very young age on. A lot of time passed until my developer story begun - inbetween I got my first computer, bought my second one and got familiar with Windows and computers in general.

One day I was ready: A friend of mine who was developing web applications already taught me some web development fundamentals and I was hooked - kind of. I gave up on it because it was hard, like really hard. I think all programmers know that starting is really hard and you need enough determination to go on with it. That determination got me through it eventually but once I had gathered some experience I knew: Web development is not it for me, at least not for now. Coming with web development I had picked up JavaScript - the one thing I did not leave behind. Using JavaScript I wrote my first Discord bots and made some pretty cool things. Everything took ages because I did not understand programming itself and just tried and tried and tried. I got deeper into the matter to understand everything on an in-depth level, switched languages multiple times (JS -> Kotlin -> Java -> Python -> Java) and now have a very solid grasp of how programming languages, their systems under the hood, compilers and so on work. My internship at Germany-wide known company Almato was a total success: Here I am, an aspiring developer with big dreams and a lot of drive to accomplish my goals.
