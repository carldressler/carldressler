<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Carl 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">A full stack developer living somewhere between design and code</h3>

- 🚀 I’m currently working on an **app to notify employess of a local public transport company about route changes** using Flutter, Firebase and Dart.
- ⭐ My favourite technologies: Java, Flutter and relational databases

<h3 align="center">My philosophy</h3>
This sounds bold, I know. Nonetheless I have a few guiding principles I base my work on.


<h4>Professionalism</h4>

Products I develop should be perfectly suitable to use in a professional area. Both code quality and application stability are hold up to that high standard.

<h4>User Interaction comes first</h4>

The best code solution is useless without someone to efficiently operate it. I develop with a user first approach, caring about implementation details only after I have made up my mind on how the user will interact with the software. This can mean more complicated code, but it always means better usability.

<h4> The extra mile </h4>

Going the extra mile pays off. May it be the product presentation, the look and feel or the fantastic support after deployment. Going the extra mile ensures customers are happy and I can make a name for myself.
